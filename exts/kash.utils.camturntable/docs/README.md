# Turntable Camera (kash.utils.camturntable)

## Overview

This Extension creates a new UI and function to create an animated turntable camera that will rotate around the world origin in one click.

## Usage

Once the extension is enabled in the `Extension Manager` the `Turntable Camera` window will appear. You may dock this window or keep it floating in the console. Click either of the two buttons to create a camera with the desired turntable animation in the scene. A sample cube shape will spawn in the world origin around which the camera will rotate. Play the scene and the turntable camera will rotate around the sample cube shape over a set duration of 10 secs (i.e.the first 240 frames at 24 frames per second). You can then hide the sample cube shape model and place your own model in the world origin to use with the turntable camera.
